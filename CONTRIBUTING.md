# Welcome to contributing guide

The purpose of this document / project is to help people getting started to write codes in Julia, if they already know MATLAB, and vice versa.

Your contribution is highly valued, especially:
- Additional topics
- Simplication of MATLAB or Julia expression. Note that we write code for human. Simple means readable by human:
   * Forcing to single line of cryptic code is not readable
   * Use readable variable names
   * Use Julia and MATLAB standard style
- Remark / notes on language specific behavior

You can submit your remark or changes via issues or pull request.

Please ensure that your snippet is:
- running on actual MATLAB or Julia
- use standard library as much as possible
